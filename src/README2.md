# Summary of Improvements

## 1. Modular Object-Oriented Structure

The refactored code transforms a 900+ line monolithic file into separate, specialized classes with clear responsibilities:

- **Encoder**: Handles quadrature encoder reading and position tracking
- **PIDController**: Manages closed-loop position control
- **StepperDriver**: Controls stepper motor operations
- **SafetyMonitor**: Monitors system safety including limit switches
- **MotionController**: Coordinates high-level motion operations
- **CommandHandler**: Processes serial commands from the user

This modular approach makes the code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## 2. Proper Encapsulation

- **Private Member Variables**: All class fields are properly encapsulated as private
- **Accessor Methods**: Public getters/setters provide controlled access to internal state
- **Clear Interfaces**: Each class has a well-defined public API

## 3. Namespace Usage

All code is organized in the `MotionSystem` namespace, preventing global symbol conflicts and providing logical organization.

## 4. Centralized Configuration

- All system parameters, pin assignments, and constants are moved to a central `Config.h` file
- Parameters are organized into nested namespaces by function
- Constants are declared as `constexpr` for compile-time optimization

## 5. Improved Safety

- Dedicated `SafetyMonitor` class handles all safety concerns
- Event-based callbacks for safety notifications
- Centralized emergency stop handling

## 6. Simplified Main Program

The `main.cpp` file is reduced from 900+ lines to about 50 lines, focusing on:
- Creating and initializing the component objects
- Starting the necessary tasks
- Processing user commands

## 7. Dependency Injection

- Classes reference each other through dependency injection
- Promotes testability by allowing mock objects to be substituted
- Facilitates unit testing of individual components

## 8. Reduced Use of Global Variables

- Global variables are eliminated in favor of class members
- Static variables are limited to cases where truly needed
- Volatile qualifier only used where necessary for ISRs

## 9. Improved ISR Handling

- ISRs are properly marked with IRAM_ATTR for execution from RAM
- Minimal code in ISRs to prevent timing issues
- ISRs properly tied to their respective classes

## 10. Better Command Processing

- Command parsing handled in a dedicated class
- Structured error reporting
- Uniform command handling

## 11. Compatibility with PlatformIO

The structure is designed to work well with PlatformIO project organization:
- Separate include and src directories
- Clear dependency management in platformio.ini
- Support for unit testing

This refactored design greatly improves code maintainability, readability, and extensibility while preserving the original functionality.
